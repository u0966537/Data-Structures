# Data-Structures
- Learn algorithms for basic searching and sorting, as well as the asymptotic behavior of each.
- Become proficient implementing and using basic data structures fundamental to computer science including arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, graphs, trees, binary search trees, Huffman trees, hash tables, binary heaps, and priority queues. Reason about the asymptotic behavior of basic operations on these data structures.
- Evaluate solutions for efficiency through written reports. Evaluations will summarize efficiency in time (Big-O and/or actual running time), efficiency in space (memory requirements), and/or programmer efficiency (ease of implementation and maintenance) of solutions.
- Gain experience using and implementing recursion. Also, be introduced to dynamic programming. Students will learn when to apply iteration or dynamic programming instead of recursion.
- Test solutions according to a variety of testing models including white-box testing, black-box testing, and unit tests.
- Gain experience designing, implementing, and testing solutions in pairs using the techniques of pair programming.
## Matrices
Implement a class that represents 2D mathematical matrices.
## Generic Books
Construct a program for libraries that allows books to be checked in and out electronically. A book is represented by an ISBN, an author, and a title, all of which cannot change once the book has been created. (Please note that ISBNs are unique.) A library book is a book together with a holder (representation of the person who has the book checked out) and a due date, both of which can change as needed. (Please note that for our purposes, all holders are unique.)
## Searching a List
Construct a program that handles lists of strings, integers, library books, and anything else our client can think of. The client requires all of the usual operations for a list, such as the ability to add items, remove items, search for items, and get items (in sorted order). Because the client expects that searching for items will be the most common operation for these lists, we must make our search routine as efficient as possible. Further, we have been informed that the lists may not contain duplicates (ie. it is a set).
