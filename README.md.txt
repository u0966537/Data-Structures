# Data-Structures
- Learn algorithms for basic searching and sorting, as well as the asymptotic behavior of each.
- Become proficient implementing and using basic data structures fundamental to computer science including arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, graphs, trees, binary search trees, Huffman trees, hash tables, binary heaps, and priority queues. Reason about the asymptotic behavior of basic operations on these data structures.
- Evaluate solutions for efficiency through written reports. Evaluations will summarize efficiency in time (Big-O and/or actual running time), efficiency in space (memory requirements), and/or programmer efficiency (ease of implementation and maintenance) of solutions.
- Gain experience using and implementing recursion. Also, be introduced to dynamic programming. Students will learn when to apply iteration or dynamic programming instead of recursion.
- Test solutions according to a variety of testing models including white-box testing, black-box testing, and unit tests.
- Gain experience designing, implementing, and testing solutions in pairs using the techniques of pair programming.
