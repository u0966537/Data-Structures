# Common Questions
## Which pivot point is the best? (middle, median, random)
From my research, I found out that random pivot is the best, middle is the second and median is the last. However, random pivot is not safe and middle is safe.
## Quicksort and Mergesort, which is faster?
Even both of them have O(N log (N)) in run time complexity except quicksort's worst case. If quicksort has a good pivot pointer, then quicksort is faster than mergesort. Also, mergesort is not in-place, it requires extra memory space.
