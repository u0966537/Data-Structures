# Common Questions
## What is the difference between Comparable and Comparator interfaces? Give a situation when it is best to use each.
- The benefit of using comparator is that you have lots of ways of sorting. For example, when both of objects are equal, then round to different comparison. 
- Use comparable if you just want natural order. For example, a list of numbers in ascending order.
## What are the benefits of using Generic code?
- Allows for type-checking at compile time instead of run-time.
- Can detect type mismatch before the code runs.
